# RebelFLOW Weekly Progress Report

## Week of March 13, 2025 - March 19, 2025

### Summary
This week marked significant progress in establishing the core framework for RebelFLOW and advancing the node editor canvas. The team focused on building the foundation for the event system, node system architecture, and workflow execution engine. We've made good progress on the user interface with initial node visualization and connection rendering. Challenges were encountered with performance optimization for large node graphs, but work is ongoing to implement virtualization and rendering optimizations. The serialization system has begun taking shape with initial JSON serialization capabilities.

### Challenges & Solutions
1. **Node Editor Performance**: The team encountered challenges with node editor performance for large graphs. Solution: Implementing virtualization for rendering only visible nodes and optimizing the rendering pipeline.
2. **Connection Routing**: Initial connection routing algorithm resulted in visual clutter with crossing lines. Solution: Researching and implementing a more sophisticated path-finding algorithm for connection routing.
3. **Type System Complexity**: Creating a flexible type system that works across different node types proved challenging. Solution: Implementing a more abstract type system with conversion capabilities and validation rules.
4. **Serialization Versioning**: Ensuring backward compatibility for serialized workflows is complex. Solution: Designing a versioned serialization format with migration paths for older versions.
