# Development Context Notes

This document maintains critical context for AI-driven development continuity across sessions. It captures key decisions, architectural insights, and development progress to ensure smooth transitions between development sessions.

## Project Overview
RebelFlow is a node-based automation tool for CAD, game development, and scripting. It provides a visual programming interface where users can create workflows by connecting nodes that represent different operations and data transformations.

## Current Development Status
- **Project Phase**: Initial setup and core infrastructure development
- **Active Module**: Core module (event system, workflow execution, and node system)
- **Current Feature**: Node System implementation
- **Development Approach**: Test-driven development with modular architecture

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Module Independence
- Each module is designed to be self-contained with clear interfaces
- Modules communicate through well-defined APIs
- Dependencies between modules are minimized and explicitly documented

### 2. Event-Driven Architecture
- The system uses an event-driven approach for node communication
- Events propagate through the node graph based on connections
- Both synchronous and asynchronous event handling are supported

### 3. Execution Model
- Workflows are executed as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)
- Nodes can be executed sequentially or in parallel where possible
- Execution state is tracked and can be visualized during runtime

### 4. Data Flow
- Data flows between nodes through typed connections
- Type validation occurs at both design-time and runtime
- Data transformations are handled by specialized nodes

## Development Progress

### Completed
- Initial project structure setup
- Development tracking system established
- Core architectural decisions documented
- Event system design and implementation
- Event system documentation
- Workflow execution system design and implementation
- Workflow execution system documentation
- Node system design and implementation
- Node system documentation

### In Progress
- UI framework development

### Pending
- Backend logic for persistence

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Targets
- Node execution overhead < 1ms per node
- UI responsiveness: 60fps minimum for canvas operations
- Memory footprint: < 500MB for typical workflows

### Technology Stack Decisions
- Core implementation language: TypeScript
- UI framework: [To be decided]
- Scripting support: Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Lua

## Known Challenges and Risks
1. Ensuring efficient execution for complex workflows
2. Balancing flexibility with ease of use
3. Managing memory for large workflows
4. Handling script execution security

## Previous Development Session Accomplishments
