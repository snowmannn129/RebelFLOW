# Current Feature: Node System

The current development focus is on implementing the **Node System** for the Core module.

## Feature Description
The Node System is responsible for:
- Defining the base node interfaces and abstract classes
- Implementing core node types (data, process, control flow)
- Creating the node connection system
- Developing node validation mechanisms
- Supporting node configuration and customization

## Implementation Goals
- Define a flexible and extensible node interface
- Implement core node types for different operations
- Create a robust connection system for data flow
- Develop validation mechanisms for node configuration
- Support node customization and extension
- Ensure proper integration with the workflow execution system

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Base node interface and abstract classes are defined
- [x] Core node types are implemented and tested
- [x] Node connection system is created and validated
- [x] Node validation mechanisms are in place
- [x] Node configuration and customization is supported
- [x] Integration with workflow execution system is complete
- [x] Unit tests cover all node system functionality
- [x] Documentation is complete and comprehensive

## Current Progress
- [x] Initial planning and architecture design
- [x] Base node interface definition
- [x] Core node types implementation
- [x] Node connection system
- [x] Node validation mechanisms
- [x] Integration with workflow execution
- [x] Unit tests for node system

## Previous Feature
The **Workflow Execution** feature has been completed, providing:
- A flexible workflow execution pipeline
- Efficient node execution sequencing with support for both sequential and parallel execution
- Robust data flow management between nodes
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Workflow control capabilities (pause, resume, stop)
- Execution state tracking and visualization
- Comprehensive unit tests and documentation
