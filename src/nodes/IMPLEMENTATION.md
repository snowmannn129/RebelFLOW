# Node System Implementation

This document describes the implementation details of the Node System module.

## Architecture Overview

The Node System is designed with a modular architecture that separates concerns into distinct components:

1. **Base Node System**: Defines the fundamental interfaces and classes for all nodes.
2. **Core Node Types**: Implements common node types for different operations.
3. **Node Connection System**: Manages connections between nodes for data flow.
4. **Node Validation System**: Validates node configurations and connections.

The architecture follows these design principles:

- **Modularity**: Each component is self-contained with clear interfaces.
- **Extensibility**: The system is designed to be easily extended with new node types and functionality.
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript is used to ensure type safety throughout the system.
- **Event-Driven**: The system uses events to communicate between components.

## Base Node System

### INode Interface

The `INode` interface defines the contract that all nodes must implement. It provides methods for:

- Basic properties (ID, type, name, status)
- Port management (inputs, outputs)
- Execution
- Configuration
- Metadata
- Validation
- Reset

### BaseNode Class

The `BaseNode` abstract class provides a base implementation of the `INode` interface. It handles:

- Port management
- Event publishing
- Default value application
- Configuration management
- Metadata management
- Status tracking

The `BaseNode` class uses the Template Method pattern, where the `execute` method defines the execution flow, but delegates the actual processing to the abstract `process` method that must be implemented by derived classes.

### NodePort Class

The `NodePort` class represents a node port (input or output). It provides:

- Port type (input or output)
- Data type
- Default value (for input ports)
- Compatibility checking

### NodeStatus Enum

The `NodeStatus` enum represents the possible states of a node:

- `IDLE`: Node is idle and ready to be executed
- `PROCESSING`: Node is currently processing
- `COMPLETED`: Node has completed execution successfully
- `FAILED`: Node execution has failed
- `CANCELLED`: Node execution has been cancelled
- `WAITING`: Node is waiting for an external event or resource

## Core Node Types

### DataNode

The `DataNode` class is used for storing and transforming data. It provides:

- Data storage and retrieval
- Optional data transformation

Implementation details:
- Stores data in a private property
- Applies transformation function if set
- Provides methods to set and get data
- Provides methods to set and clear transformation function

### ProcessNode

The `ProcessNode` class is used for processing operations. It provides:

- Custom processing logic through a function

Implementation details:
- Takes a process function in the constructor
- Delegates processing to the provided function
- Provides method to update the process function

### ControlFlowNode

The `ControlFlowNode` class is used for controlling the flow of execution. It provides:

- Condition-based routing (if/else)
- Switch/case routing
- Custom routing

Implementation details:
- Supports three routing modes: condition, routing, and custom routing
- Only one routing mode can be active at a time
- Initializes all outputs to undefined
- Routes data based on the active routing mode

## Node Connection System

### NodeConnection

The `NodeConnection` class represents a connection between two nodes. It provides:

- Source and target node/port information
- Connection validation
- Data transfer

Implementation details:
- Validates connection by checking port compatibility
- Transfers data from source to target by mapping source port data to target port

### ConnectionManager

The `ConnectionManager` class manages connections between nodes. It provides:

- Connection creation and validation
- Connection retrieval by ID, node, or port
- Connection removal

Implementation details:
- Uses UUID for connection IDs
- Validates connections before creation
- Prevents duplicate connections
- Prevents multiple connections to the same input port
- Publishes events when connections are created or removed

## Node Validation System

### ValidationRule

The `ValidationRule` class defines a validation rule for nodes. It provides:

- Rule identification (ID, name)
- Validation function
- Error message

Implementation details:
- Takes a validation function in the constructor
- Validates a node by applying the validation function
- Returns true if the node passes validation, false otherwise

### NodeValidator

The `NodeValidator` class validates nodes and workflows against a set of rules. It provides:

- Rule management (add, get, remove)
- Node validation
- Connection validation
- Workflow validation

Implementation details:
- Adds default rules in the constructor
- Validates a node against all rules or a subset of rules
- Validates a connection by checking port compatibility
- Validates a workflow by validating all nodes and connections
- Returns detailed validation results with error information

## Integration with Core Module

The Node System integrates with the Core module in several ways:

1. **Event System**: Nodes publish events during execution using the Core event system.
2. **Workflow Execution**: The Node System provides the nodes that are executed by the Core workflow execution system.
3. **Data Flow**: The Node Connection System manages the data flow between nodes during workflow execution.

## Performance Considerations

The Node System is designed with performance in mind:

- **Minimal Overhead**: The base node implementation adds minimal overhead to node execution.
- **Efficient Data Transfer**: The connection system efficiently transfers data between nodes.
- **Lazy Validation**: Validation is performed only when requested, not during normal operation.

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements to the Node System include:

1. **Node Templates**: Pre-configured node templates for common operations.
2. **Node Groups**: Support for grouping nodes together for organization and reuse.
3. **Dynamic Ports**: Support for dynamically adding and removing ports at runtime.
4. **Port Type System**: A more sophisticated type system for port compatibility checking.
5. **Node Versioning**: Support for versioning nodes to handle compatibility issues.
